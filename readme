## Overview
The project processes data from the IBGE API to analyze the relationship between the number of chicken breeders and the number of hatching eggs produced. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization steps to provide insights into trends and performance metrics.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and converts data types for analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Calculates metrics such as yield, moving averages, and year-over-year growth.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Monthly and quarterly moving averages of chicken breeder herds.
  - Year-over-year growth of hatching egg production.
  - Yield trends over time.
- **Outputs**: Saves visualizations as PNG files.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `requests`
- `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using pip:
